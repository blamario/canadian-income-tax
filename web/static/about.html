    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This Web site is running an instance of free and
    open, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/#GPL">GPL</a>-licensed software for calculating Canadian income taxes.
    <p>It does not collect your private information, nor does it even ask for any. If in doubt, you can
      <a href="https://github.com/blamario/canadian-income-tax">download</a>, build, and run the same software on your
      home computer. Or you can use this site and submit your forms without providing any identifying information.
    <p>That being said, there are some limitations to what the software can do:
      <ul>
        <li>If you're married or live with a common-law partner, congratulations, but you'll have to complete your two
          returns separately and take care to manually update any cross-referencing fields.
        <li>If you live in Quebec, the only form we can complete is T1 because Revenu Québec does not provide any
          electronically fillable forms. If you're mad about that, complain to Revenu Québec.
        <li>If you live outside of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, or Ontario, your provincial forms are not
          supported <em>yet</em>, and even for Manitoba the provincial credit form <code>MB479</code> is not
          supported. That's because life is short, there are many provinces and territories, and every one of them
          has different forms. If you're mad that your province or territory is not
          on the list, <a href="https://github.com/blamario/canadian-income-tax/issues">complain</a> and we'll help you
          contribute the missing code.
        <li>Finally there are many federal tax schedule forms that you may or may not need. Presently we can complete
          only schedule 6, 9, and 11 &mdash; any others you'll have to complete manually. We plan to add support for
          more schedules in time. If need one of the missing schedules you can complete it manually or contribute
          code to complete it automatically.
      </ul>
    <p><b>We do <em>not</em> provide any guarantees</b>; after using this software you are still responsible for
      completing any missing data (including your identification for CRA) and verifying the overall correctness of the
      tax return.
    <p>Furthermore, you'll need to print your tax return forms, sign them, and mail them yourself. For some reason CRA
      does not permit electronic submissions from open-source software. If you're mad about that, complain to CRA.
    <p>Go and <a href="/">complete your taxes</a> already!</p>
